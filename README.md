# FactoryPattern

Factory Pattern is a design pattern. Its intents include:

* Create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
* Enable to user to refer to the newly created object through a common interface.

In this demo, reflection is used to decide to initialize an object of which concrete class.
